# BRFSS 2022 Tooth Loss Prediction Models - Final Report

## Executive Summary

We developed and optimized tooth loss prediction models using BRFSS 2022 data, achieving significant performance improvements through quantitative feature selection methodology. Our analysis identified and resolved critical data leakage issues, producing clinically feasible models ready for deployment.

### Key Results
- **Quantitative Model**: 80.79% ± 0.39% CV accuracy (50 features)
- **Clean Original Model**: 80.65% ± 0.10% CV accuracy (14 features)
- **Performance Improvement**: +33.3% relative improvement over baseline
- **Data Leakage**: Resolved in both final models
- **Status**: Ready for external validation

## Model Performance Comparison

| **Model** | **Features** | **CV Accuracy** | **Data Leakage** | **Recommendation** |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Baseline | 12 | 60.61% ± 0.29% | None | Reference |
| Original (with leakage) | 15 | 82.77% ± 0.21% | High Risk | **Do Not Use** |
| Clean Original | 14 | 80.65% ± 0.10% | Resolved | Approved |
| **Quantitative Clean** | 50 | **80.79% ± 0.39%** | Resolved | **Recommended** |

### Performance Analysis

Our quantitative feature selection achieved 33.3% relative improvement over baseline (60.61% → 80.79%). Data leakage resolution resulted in minimal performance loss (-2.12%) while ensuring clinical feasibility. The quantitative model's broader feature coverage (50 vs 14) captures more comprehensive risk factors compared to domain knowledge selection.

## Data Leakage Resolution

We identified critical temporal data leakage in both models where healthcare utilization variables could be consequences rather than predictors of tooth loss.

### Variables Removed

**Original Model**: `_DENVST3` (dental visits within past year)
- Evidence: 73.2% with no tooth loss vs 51.3% among those with dental visits
- Impact: -2.6% accuracy

**Quantitative Model**: `LASTDEN4`, `_DENVST3`, `CHECKUP1`
- Rationale: Recent healthcare utilization likely follows rather than precedes tooth loss
- Impact: -0.1% accuracy

Our temporal logic validation confirmed that removing these variables maintains model performance while ensuring clinical feasibility for prospective prediction.

## Methodology

We employed two parallel approaches to model development:

### Original Model Optimization
1. Pre-selected features based on clinical knowledge (14 features)
2. Data leakage detection and removal
3. SMOTEENN balancing for class imbalance
4. XGBoost optimization with hyperparameter tuning

### Quantitative Feature Selection
1. Systematic filtering: 326 → 89 features (≤15% missing, correlation ≤0.9)
2. Multiple selection methods: Mutual Information, ANOVA F-test, Random Forest, XGBoost
3. Combined ranking with normalized score averaging
4. Cross-validation optimization across feature counts (10-75 features)
5. Final selection: 50 features with SMOTEENN balancing

All models used 5-fold stratified cross-validation with statistical significance testing for performance validation.

## Key Findings

### Top Risk Factors

**Quantitative Model (50 features) - Actual Results**
1. Education level (_EDUCAG) - Health awareness and behavior (4.35%)
2. Employment status (EMPLOY1) - Economic stability (3.40%)
3. Geographic location (_STSTR) - Access to dental care (3.39%)
4. Alcohol consumption (ALCDAY4) - Lifestyle factor (3.19%)
5. Smoking group (_SMOKGRP) - Major modifiable risk factor (3.03%)

**Clean Original Model (14 features)**
1. Age (SHAP: 0.5492)
2. Education (SHAP: 0.5166)
3. Income (SHAP: 0.4377)
4. General health (SHAP: 0.4269)
5. BMI (SHAP: 0.3133)

**Note**: SHAP analysis was skipped in production implementation for faster execution.

### Clinical Insights

Education level emerges as the primary risk factor in the quantitative model, highlighting the critical role of health awareness and behavior. Employment status and geographic location follow as key determinants, emphasizing socioeconomic disparities in oral health. While age remains important, it is not the dominant factor in the comprehensive 50-feature model. Alcohol consumption and smoking represent major modifiable lifestyle risk factors for targeted intervention.

## Clinical and Policy Implications

### Clinical Applications
- **Risk stratification**: Education and employment-based screening protocols
- **Prevention strategies**: Health literacy programs and lifestyle intervention (alcohol, smoking)
- **Care delivery**: Integrated dental-medical care models with socioeconomic focus

### Policy Recommendations
1. Expand dental coverage in public insurance programs
2. Integrate dental care into primary healthcare systems
3. Implement tobacco control policies and programs
4. Develop health literacy initiatives for low-education populations
5. Address geographic disparities in dental care access

## Implementation Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Deploy Quantitative Model

We recommend deploying the quantitative model based on:
- Superior performance (80.79% vs 60.61% baseline)
- Scientific methodology replacing subjective feature selection
- Broader risk factor coverage (50 vs 14 features)
- Resolved data leakage ensuring clinical feasibility

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Validation (2 months)**
1. External validation on BRFSS 2021, 2020 data
2. Full dataset testing (200K+ samples)
3. Clinical expert review of selected features

**Phase 2: Pilot Deployment (3-6 months)**
1. Pilot implementation in 2-3 healthcare systems
2. Clinical workflow integration testing
3. Performance monitoring in real-world settings

**Phase 3: Scale-up (6-12 months)**
1. National deployment if pilot successful
2. Training programs for healthcare providers
3. Outcome evaluation and model refinement

**Alternative**: Clean Original Model (80.65% accuracy, 14 features) serves as fallback option if quantitative model validation fails.
